  # Fix RLS policies for wallet-based authentication

  1. Problem
    - Current policies expect JWT with wallet_address claim
    - We're inserting data directly without JWT authentication
    - This causes "row violates row-level security policy" errors

  2. Solution
    - Update policies to work with direct wallet address matching
    - Allow public read access for capsule viewing
    - Allow authenticated users to insert/update based on wallet ownership
    - Remove JWT dependency for basic operations

  3. Changes
    - Simplify RLS policies
    - Allow anon users to read and insert (for wallet-based auth)
    - Keep owner-based restrictions for updates
